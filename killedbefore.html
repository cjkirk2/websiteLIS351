 <h1>Just a website tribute to the GOAT, Young Thug!</h1>
  
  <h2><u><I>Killed Before</I> by Young Thug</u></h2>
   <p>This song appears on Young Thug's collaborative mixtape with fellow rapper <b>Future</b>, called <b><I>Super Slimey</I></b>.<I>Killed Before</I> is probably top three of Thug's greatest songs, in my opinion, and to experience it in person was truly amazing!</p>
<p>Below is just the beginning of one of his more elegant pieces. <b>Please enjoy!</b></p>
