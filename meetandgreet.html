  <h2><u>My Meet & Greet with Young Thug</u></h2>
   <p>This picture was taken shortly after his performance at The Rave in <b>Milwaukee, Wisconsin</b>, hands down one of the best days of my life. </p>
<p>During the meet and greet, the security told me, "Don't think about getting a bro hug with him, because you won't." Surely, it was my turn to meet him and he liked my shirt, so he dapped me up anyway.</p>
