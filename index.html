 <h1>Just a website tribute to the GOAT, Young Thug!</h1>
  
  <h2><u>Who is Young Thug?</u></h2>
   <p>Jeffery Lamar Williams, or better known as <b>Young Thug</b>, is a professional rapper in the Hip-Hop Industry and is one of the most influential rappers of this decade!</p>
   <p>He is also well known for the absurd rebrand of his name "<b>SEX</b>", which he claimed to prefer this name in February of 2018. Attached is the link to the official tweet sent out by Thug himself:<a href="https://twitter.com/youngthug/status/965829836416536576?lang=en" target="_blank">SEX tweet</a></p> 
   <p><b>Young Thug</b> was born on August 16, 1991, in Atlanta, Georgia. He would then make his way onto the rap scene as soon as 2010, but would not get the recognition he so ought to deserve until the release of his debut album: <b><I>So Much Fun</I></b>, on his birthday in 2019. The album would then go on to be certified <b>platinum</b>, marking this as his highest-selling work of his career. </p> 


  <h2><u>What you will experience while on this website:</u></h2>
   <p>Back in October of 2019, I was able to attend an all-access meet & greet with <b>21st Century's Most Influential Rapper</b> and I had a front row experience to his show at <I>The Rave</I> in <b>Milwaukee, Wisconsin</b> that I wanted to share with you all.</p> 
   <p>Below is a list of a couple performances I captured on video as well as a photo of him and I after his performance:</p>
